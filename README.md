# Instructions
The purpose of this tool is to clean up the poor ASCII that is obtained by mousing NSF reviews
from Fastlane into a doc. 

1) Mouse your panel summary (including all lines) into a text file rev1.txt

2) Mouse in each review after the panel summary

3) run nsfreviewcleaner as:

> nsfreviewcleaner > t.txt

this produces a new text file.    Now mouse t.txt into MS Word, LibreOffice, Google Docs, etc. for a much nicer reading experince. 

Coming in next version:  editing the reviews themselves to preserve your ego!
